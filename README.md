# ⭐️Discrete Structures - Cryptography with RSA Encryption⭐️

Welcome to the Discrete Structures repository for Cryptography using RSA encryption and decryption. 

This repository contains code that demonstrates RSA encryption and decryption for text data. You can use this code to encrypt your text and then decrypt it.

## About RSA Encryption⭐️

RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is a widely-used public-key cryptosystem that can be used for secure data transmission. It uses asymmetric encryption, meaning it uses a pair of keys for encryption and decryption: a public key (used for encryption) and a private key (used for decryption). 

The process of RSA encryption and decryption involves the following steps:

1. **Key Generation⭐️:**
   - A pair of public and private keys is generated.
   - The public key is shared with others, while the private key is kept secret.

2. **Encryption⭐️:**
   - The sender uses the recipient's public key to encrypt the message.
   - The encrypted message can only be decrypted using the recipient's private key.

3. **Decryption⭐️:**
   - The recipient uses their private key to decrypt the message and obtain the original content.

4. **Security⭐️:**
   - RSA is secure due to the difficulty of factoring large semiprime numbers, which are used in key generation.

## Repository Contents⭐️
